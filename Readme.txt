Application: EagleSIS - Sensitive Information Scanner
Application: EagleSIS - Scanner Database Viewer
============================================================================

This application was created using Visual Studio 2010, with .NET framework
    3.5. The code is distributed over various components. The Main 
    application code just calls the various modules that are compiled as 
    Dynamically Linked Library (DLL). The .NET DLLs are baked into the 
    assembly, but SQLite.Interop.dll and Scanner(DLL) is required to be 
    part of the code.
