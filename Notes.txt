Steven and Cyrus worked on C++
	- Steven should still @ ewu
	- Cyrus worked on Communication layer
	- debug was done by tests for modules and some test beds
	- Steven's should still be up there, others probably not
	- Created one solution and then made another for the DLL project
	- They were going to do one project, 
	- Build parser, just needs to strip out the text for any file
	- All parsers are added as assemblies,
	- Engine is added using p/invoke
		- http://pinvoke.net/
		- some marshaling stuff and sequential stuff
		- Have to tell C# it is sequential
	- IFilter were not consistent on different machines with different office installs
	- Steven was importing dll file into another 
	
	
Two Bugs in engine:
	- When there is SSN by it self in file and nothing else, no spaces, new lines it will
	not detect it 
	- When there were two SSN on same line separated by single space, it would only return one and
	skip over the second.
	
PST OST - Were closed source 

- Using PST parser through java, it is a place holder

- Password protection on PST files
	- Found algorithm that cracks the password, Cyrus will email Matt regarding pst cracking
	
- If admin, but can't access file, take ownership of file?? OIT did not like it
- If encrypted in EFS, admin would not be able to access unless they took ownership
	- Their solution was to get it wiped ??ITVM?? does not access much
	
- Work on other features before PST file stuff cause of pstsdk
